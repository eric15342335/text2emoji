Functionalities supported currently (March 1):
Characters convertible to emojis: numbers 0-9, lower case a-z, upper case A-Z, !, ?, +, -, ร, รท
For python version, it takes user input and re-trial is enabled if user responds via pressing 1.
For C++ version, re-trial is not supported, instead it will prompt press anyting to exit.
For the shell script version, the character string is taken via a command line argument and no user input will be needed.
The python and c++ version also support returning unconvertible characters as is back to the user but NOT on the shell script version which would remove unconvertible characters from the output.
